# PlantDiseaseClassification_UsingTransferLearning
This repository contains code and resources for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project that uses transfer learning to classify plant diseases in the Plant Village dataset. In this project, we fine-tune various pre-trained models, including VGG16, MobileNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet101V2, achieving impressive accuracy rates.

# Overview
In this project, we explore the use of transfer learning to classify plant diseases using five different pre-trained models: VGG16, MobileNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, and ResNet101V2. The primary goal is to accurately identify plant diseases, which is crucial for crop management and disease prevention in agriculture.

# Dataset
We used the Plant Village dataset, a comprehensive collection of images featuring various plant diseases and healthy plants. It consists of 39 classes , making it a valuable resource for training and evaluating our models.

# Usage
```bash

git clone https://github.com/Divyan-shu-Singh/PlantDiseaseClassification_UsingTransferLearning.git
```
# Results
Here are the accuracy rates achieved by each model:

* VGG16: 94.04%
* MobileNetV2: 94.87%
* InceptionResNetV2: 93.35%
* InceptionV3: 92.19%
* ResNet101V2: 95.24%

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in classifying plant diseases accurately.
